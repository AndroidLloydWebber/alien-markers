## Team Responsibilities 

Frontend (Mark, Victor)
Backend (JR, TK, Mark, Victor)
## Concept
User arrives on website

User will see one big map, with already created events by other users

User can create their own events, and add them to the map

User can search for already created events, and get more info on them upon clicking them


 
## Rough Breakdown of Process
Brainstormed concepts we wanted to incorporate (create event, search event)

Sketched out UI/UX designs

Determined APIs that would allow us to achieve concept aspirations

Acquired the necessary data from our APIs

Styled, formatted, and “beautified”
